pub enum NumaAllocationPolicy
{
	/// `MPOL_DEFAULT`.
	///
	/// This mode requests that any non-default policy be removed, restoring default behavior.
	///
	/// When applied to a range of memory this means to use the thread memory policy, which may have been set with the syscall `set_mempolicy`.
	///
	/// If the mode of the thread memory policy is also `NumaNodePolicy::Default`, then the system-wide default policy will be used.
	/// The system-wide default policy allocates pages on the node of the CPU that triggers the allocation.
	Default,

	/// `MPOL_PREFERRED`.
	///
	/// This mode sets the preferred node for allocation.
	///
	/// The kernel will try to allocate pages from this node first and fall back to other nodes if the preferred node is low on free memory.
	///
	/// The first node in the bit set will be selected as the preferred node.
	/// If the NUMA node bit set is empty, then the memory is allocated on the node of the CPU that triggered the allocation.
	Preferred(NumaNodeBitSet),

	/// `MPOL_BIND`.
	///
	/// This mode specifies a strict policy that restricts memory allocation to the nodes specified in nodemask.
	///
	/// Page allocations will come from the node in the NUMA node node bit set with sufficient free memory that is closest to the node where the allocation takes place.
	/// Pages will not be allocated from any node not specified in the NUMA node node bit set.
	Bind(NumaNodeBitSet),

	/// `MPOL_INTERLEAVE`.
	///
	/// This mode specifies that page allocations be interleaved across the set of nodes specified in the NUMA node bit set.
	///
	/// This optimizes for bandwidth instead of latency by spreading out pages and memory accesses to those pages across multiple nodes.
	/// To be effective the memory area should be fairly large, at least 1 MB or bigger with a fairly uniform access pattern.
	/// Accesses to a single page of the area will still be limited to the memory bandwidth of a single node.
	Interleave(NumaNodeBitSet),

	/// `MPOL_LOCAL`.
	///
	/// This mode specifies "local allocation"; the memory is allocated on the node of the CPU that triggered the allocation (the "local node").
	///
	/// If the "local node" is low on free memory, the kernel will try to allocate memory from other nodes.
	/// The kernel will allocate memory from the "local node"  whenever memory for this node is available.
	/// If the "local node" is not allowed by the thread's current cpuset context, the kernel will try to allocate memory from other nodes.
	/// The kernel will allocate memory from the "local node" whenever it becomes allowed by the thread's current cpuset context.
	///
	/// Since Linux 3.8.
