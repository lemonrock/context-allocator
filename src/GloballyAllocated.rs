/// Needed for `Vec`, `String`, `Arc`, `Rc` and the like when shared between threads in messages.
///
/// This is because `String` and `Vec`, for example, don't allocate if constructed with an empty capacity; thus it is possible to create an instance whilst in the context, say, of a ThreadAllocator but then resize in the context of a GlobalAllocator.
/// Since no allocation has occurred, the ThreadAllocator won't be tracking the memory for, say, the `String`.
/// Hence memory gets freed in a thread-unsafe manner.
/// Oops!
