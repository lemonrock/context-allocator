/// This is a very simple bump allocator of minimal utility.
///
/// It:-
///
/// * Can efficiently shrink and grow (reallocate) for the most recent allocation made (useful when pushing to a RawVec, say).
/// * Has no wrapping around at the end (but this could be achieved using a mirror ring buffer).
/// * Has no ability to resize in place if dead space occurs before next allocation because of alignment.
///
/// Is suitable for use with short-lived coroutines, such as those used to make a DNS query.
