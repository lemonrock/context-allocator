//! # context-allocator
//! 
//! This provides allocators suitable for a number of use cases.
//!
//! All of these allocators implement the traits `::std::alloc::GlobalAlloc` and `::std::alloc::Alloc`, as we as a common base trait, `Allocator`.
//!
//! The most useful is a global allocator which allows switching between thread, coroutine and global (and thuse lockable) memory allocators, using the macro `global_thread_and_coroutine_switchable_allocator()`.
//!
//! Allocators provided include:-
//!
//! * `BumpAllocator`, a never-freeing bump allocator with slight optimization for reallocating the last allocation.
//! * `BitSetAllocator`, an allocator that uses a bit set of free blocks; uses 64-bit chunks to optimize searches.
//! * `MultipleBinarySearchTreeAllocator`, an efficient allocator which minimizes fragmentation by using multiple red-black trees of free blocks which are aggresively defragmented.
//! * `ContextAllocator`, a choice of either `BumpAllocator`, `BitSetAllocator` or `MultipleBinarySearchTreeAllocator`.
//! * `MemoryMapAllocator`, a mmap allocator with support for NUMA policies.
//! * `GlobalThreadAndCoroutineSwitchableAllocator`, suitable for replacing the global allocator and provides switchable allocators for global, thread local and context (coroutine) local needs.
//!
//! Allocators use a `MemorySource` to obtain and release memory.
//! Memory sources provided include:-
//!
//! * `MemoryMapAllocator`, useful for thread-local allocators as it can obtain memory from NUMA-local memory.
//! * `ArenaMemorySource`, an arena of fixed blocks which is itself backed by a memory source; this is useful as a source for the `BumpAllocator` and `BitSetAllocator` when used for contexts.
//!
//! Additionally a number of adaptors are provided:-
//!
//! * `AllocatorAdaptor`, an adaptor of `Allocator` to `GlobalAlloc` and `Alloc`; use it by calling `Allocator.adapt()`
//! * `GlobalAllocToAllocatorAdaptor`, an adaptor of `GlobalAlloc` to `Allocator`, useful for assigning a global allocator to `GlobalThreadAndCoroutineSwitchableAllocator`.
//! * `AllocToAllocatorAdaptor`, an adaptor of `Alloc` to `Allocator`.
//!
//! When using `GlobalThreadAndCoroutineSwitchableAllocator`, it is possible to save and restore the allocator state for the currently running context (coroutine).
//! It is also possible to create a lockless, fast thread-local allocator which make use of NUMA memory, unlike a conventional malloc.
//!
//!
//! ## Future
//!
//! * Investigate using DPDK's allocator.
//! * Investigate a B-tree backed allocator.
//! * Investigate a design that uses multiple doubly-linked 'free' lists of blocks; blocks can be variable in size but the free list is sorted
//! 	* Iteration over a particular free-list range may encountered blocks too small, or blocks so large they can be split up.
//! 	* This design is similar to that used by DPDK.
//! 	* To make the allocator multi-threaded, DPDK takes a spin lock on a particular 'heap', which is a set of free lists.
//! * Investigate an arena allocator for fixed-size blocks (suitable for holding ready-to-rumble context allocators, say).
//! * Investigate a fall-back over-size allocator for a thread-local allocator, which could use the `NumaMemoryMapAllocator` underneath.
//! * Investigate supporting over-size allocations in `MultipleBinarySearchTreeAllocator` by scanning the largest binary search tree for contiguous blocks.
//! * Investigate a persistent-memory backed allocator.
//! * Properly support excess allocations and Alloc's grow_in_place functions, but only if these are used by downstream collections.
//! * Investigate the use of the `BMI1` intrinsics `_blsi_u64` (extract lowest set bit), `_blsmsk_u64` and `_blsr_u64`.
